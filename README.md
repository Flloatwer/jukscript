# JukSCRIPT V01

Welcome to **JukSCRIPT**! A very basic scripting (almost assembly-like) language that uses lines to store data. Written completely in Python, it is very simple to use. Just run `main.py`, type in a filename, and it will do the rest for you.

## Commands
- `pXXXX` - Print the content of line XXXX.
- `iXXXX` - Ask for input and store it at line XXXX.
- `+XXXXYYYYZZZZ` - Add the content of line XXXX and YYYY together and store the output at line ZZZZ. The `+` can be replaced with `-`, `/`, or `*`.
- `lXXXX` - Open the file whose filename is stored at line XXXX.
- `jXXXX` - Jump to line XXXX.
- `cXXXXYYYY` - Compare the content of line XXXX with the content of line YYYY. If the comparison is true, then jump 1 line; if false, then jump 2 lines.

**Caution:** Each XXXX, YYYY, or ZZZZ must be 4 digits long (e.g., line 1 should be represented as 0001).

Commands to create and store files are coming soon.
